Maintenance Release Notes

This section lists features of BTMS 

January 2, 2004

1. You can control and have an idea about whatever transaction you do 
   in different banks.

2. You can view reports about your accounts and the balance for each
   one plus the transactions made on each account.

3. To backup your data all you have to do is to make a copy of btms.dll
   file and when you want to retrieve your data all you have to do 
   is to replace the existing dll with the one you saved as a backup

4. There are two types of users, Regular users and Administrators. As
   a regular user you can only add accounts and transactions for your
   account. Administrators can do all but they cannot add transactions.

5. The Default Administrator is LoginID/Password .. Admin/Admin

6. Good luck, thank you for using BTMS.
